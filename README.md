Logging system with roles and adding new employees by the admin
Each customer can have a comment from an employee added to their card.
On the home page each day at midnight, ten random users are downloaded from api (randomuser.me) and are placed in an proxy table using Cron jobs. You can complete the data and add it to the main customer table. Before each download from api, the proxy table is cleared.
